# Home Assistant Add-on: WieZorgtAI

AI module created for the WieZorgt project.

## About

The WieZorgt project focuses on tackling the heightened workload of care professionals in the field of dementia care. As the elderly population with dementia continues to grow, so does the demand for dedicated care. Unfortunately, the number of care professionals is failing to keep pace, exacerbating the situation further. To address this pressing issue, we have introduced a smart technological solution â€“ an Intelligent Care Environment. This innovation is designed to significantly alleviate the workload of caregivers. Moreover, this project incorporates a home assistant addon, which has been specifically crafted for the endeavor. The addon plays a pivotal role in integrating AI into the system.
